    "question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?",
    "ground_truth": "Final Answer: $10",
    "ground_truth_extracted": "10",
    "generated_response": "To find out how much Weng earned, you need to multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she worked. In this case, Weng worked for 50 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, you can convert the 50 minutes to hours by dividing 50 by 60: 50 / 60 = 0.8333 hours. Now you can multiply 0.8333 hours by Weng's hourly rate of $12 to find out how much she earned: 0.8333 * $12 = $10.0004. So, Weng earned $10.0004 in 50 minutes.",
